CIV_ENV 205,Engineering Economics,Math 220-1,IEMS Major Program: Engineering Econ,"The course introduces students to fundamental concepts in economics and finance in the context of decisions that arise in contemporary planning and management of social and environmentally-relevant engineering systems. Intended Audience
The intended audience for this course consists of undergraduate students in Engineering and Sciences. The course satisﬁes a basic engineering requirement in the systems engineering and analysis category.

Objectives
 Instill in students a recognition and appreciation that large-scale, long-term engineering projects have complex economic, environmental and social consequences and tradeoﬀs. In this context, the course aims to provide students technical tools to represent, evaluate, and select among projects based on their ﬁnancial consequences;
Prepare students to become ﬁnancially conversant in their professional careers and personal lives;
Allow the students to become proﬁcient in the use of commercial software to solve engineering problems; and
Prepare students to take advanced courses in systems engineering, ﬁnancial engineering and managerial accounting."

I see this class as an opportunity for you, the student, to see what computer programming is all about and (more importantly) to see whether you want to spend the next few years doing more of it. This course will include weekly programming projects, readings, a midterm, and final examinations. Class participation is not optional."
COMP_SCI 150,Fundamentals of Computer Programming 1.5,COMP_SCI 110 or COMP_SCI 111 or GEN_ENG 205-1 or GEN_ENG 206-1 or CS MS.,IEMS Major Program: Computing (2/3),"Intended for students who have completed COMP_SCI 111, but don’t have any other formal Computer Science background. It will provide an introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, preparing students for future courses such as COMP_SCI 211"
COMP_SCI 217,Data Management,COMP_SCI 110 or COMP_SCI 111 or COMP_SCI 150 or COMP_SCI 211 or other programming experience,IEMS Major Program: Computing (3/3),"This course will teach students how to organize and analyze real-world data sets using tools that are most commonly used in the business world. In particular, students will learn the SQL language for analyzing data in relational databases. Students will also learn the details of common data encodings (integer, floating point, fixed point, text, date and time), how such data are structured in data files, and how to model complex data sets as a series of SQL tables. In other words, students will learn how to organize large data sets, and to answer questions using that data. The SQL skills taught in COMP_SCI 217 are essential for “data science” practitioners, especially when working with business data. COMP_SCI 217 is all about data, but not really about statistics, visualization, or programming (except SQL, which will be taught). Homework assignments will use the SQ database management systems. Some homework needs basic python programming as well.
COMP_SCI 217 is different from the COMP_SCI 339 and ELEC_ENG/COMP_ENG 495 “Introduction to Databases” courses that we offer to computer science students in that COMP_SCI 217 does not teach the details of how database management systems are built. In other words, the students in this class will learn how to use a database system, not how to build it from scratch.Formerly COMP_SCI 317. COURSE OUTCOMES: After completing this course, a student should be able to:

Draw a data model diagram to represent a complex data set.
Choose appropriate data types to store various data.
Define data integrity constraints using primary, foreign, and unique keys.
Define indexes to optimize the performance of particular queries on a database.
Implement a data model with “CREATE TABLE” commands in the SQL language.
Load data into the database tables from CSV and other data file formats.
Write complex SQL SELECT queries to answer various questions using the database. Structured Query Language (SQL)
Basic SQL statements
JOINs and aggregates
Subqueries and combining selects
Advanced queries
Data modeling for relational databases
Primary and foreign keys
Table relationships (many-to-one, many-to-many, and subsets)
Design database model
Representation of data: Integers, Floating-point numbers, text, etc
Beyond SQL database
Databases in a distributed setting
NoSQL NOTE: This course does not count for credit for CS and CE majors (they are expected to take COMP_SCI 339) – however, it counts for other majors."
